            Hello, my name is Ivan Faturahman. I'm just a guy who like to study about IT stuff, mostly about networking and web developing.
            I enjoy playing video games (of course) and enjoy consuming variety of entertainments that exist in the internet (no, social media is not entertainment).
            I also like to bring balance in my life, so whenever I feel myself being a couch potato,
            I'll exert myself to do some physical activities. Don't sit too much! That can kill ya! Am I right or am I right.
        </p>
        <p>            
            So, about this blog, I'm planning to write at least one post every week (could be anyday of the week). And the topic of the post
            could be either networking or web developing or random thoughts or commentary about stupid stuff or 
            anything. My personal blog. My rule. That's it, and to whoever willing to spend their time reading
            my posts, wish you have a good day and welcome to the Spilled Bits. Where my random thoughts, scribbles, and other weird stuffs are cached.
