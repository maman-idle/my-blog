            Hello, my name is Ivan Faturahman. If you are reading this, you probably know about this site from
            my LinkedIn or CV, so I don't think I need to explain more about myself. And for the most people who read LinkedIn profile or CV, usually are HRD, so good luck
            on getting the right employee for the vacant position on your company. For the rest of you who somehow get here without knowing from my LinkedIn or CV, 
            well click <a href="https://ivan15.pages.dev/" target="_blank">HERE</a>
            to get to know me.  
        </p>
        <p>            
            About this blog. I'm planning to write at least one post every week. And the topic of the post
            could be either networking or web developing or random thoughts or commentary about stupid stuff or 
            anything. My personal blog. My rule. That's it, and to whoever willing to spend their time reading
            my posts, wish you have a good day and welcome to the Spilled Bits. Where my random thoughts, scribbles, and other weird stuffs are cached.     
        </p>
